## **Style Guides**

### Python
[**PEP8:**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction) Is the defacto standard for Python programming and is recomended for all applicable projects.

> One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts".

### Notepadd++
Notepadd++ is a very simple editor. It is best to think of it as an improved version of notepad. Much like Vim it has the advantage of being able to read almost any file type. Notepad++ is often used to hold snippets and repair improperly encoded text.

### Vim
Vim is our standard editor in Linux enviornments. This editor is a lightweight editor which lacks features such as linters and auto-complete. This editor is an excelent choice for small changes on deployed code.
